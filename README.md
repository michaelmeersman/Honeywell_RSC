# Honeywell_RSC

This repository is for reading pressure (and temperature) from Honeywell RSC sensors. It is designed to be used for a "Pressure Scanner" involving any number of pressure sensors. This is for research work at the University of Arizona involving Free-flight experiments of scaled UAV's where I will be measuring pressure distribution over a wing.

Most of the help I received in writing this software was from the Texas Instruments TI ADS1220 Datasheet as well as a sample code written by @ij96.
